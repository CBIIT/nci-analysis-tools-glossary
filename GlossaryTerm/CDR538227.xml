For example, breast cancer in a hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome family member who does not carry the family’s <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> or <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation would be considered a phenocopy. Such an individual does not have the family’s cancer-related mutation and therefore, they do not have the associated cancer risk from that specific mutation.</DefinitionText><Dictionary>Genetics</Dictionary><Audience>Health professional</Audience></TermDefinition><MediaLink ref="CDR0000736905" type="audio/mpeg" alt="Pronunciation of dictionary term &quot;phenocopy&quot;" language="en" id="_2"/><DateFirstPublished>2007-03-02</DateFirstPublished></GlossaryTerm>
