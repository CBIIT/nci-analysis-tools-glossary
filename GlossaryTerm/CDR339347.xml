It is sometimes used to differentiate cancers occurring in people who do not have a germline mutation that confers increased susceptibility to cancer from cancers occurring in people who are known to carry a mutation. Cancer developing in people who do not carry a high-risk mutation is referred to as sporadic cancer. The distinction is not absolute, because genetic background may influence the likelihood of cancer even in the absence of a specific predisposing mutation. Alternatively, sporadic is also sometimes used to describe cancer occurring in individuals without a family history of cancer.</DefinitionText><Dictionary>Genetics</Dictionary><Audience>Health professional</Audience></TermDefinition><MediaLink ref="CDR0000711601" type="audio/mpeg" alt="Pronunciation of dictionary term &quot;sporadic cancer&quot;" language="en" id="_3"/><MediaLink ref="CDR0000711600" type="audio/mpeg" alt="Pronunciation of dictionary term &quot;cáncer esporádico&quot;" language="es" id="_4"/><SpanishTermName>cáncer esporádico</SpanishTermName><SpanishTermDefinition><DefinitionText>Cáncer que se presenta en personas que no tienen antecedentes familiares de ese cáncer ni un cambio heredado en el ADN que aumentaría el riesgo de padecer de ese cáncer.</DefinitionText><Dictionary>Cancer.gov</Dictionary><Audience>Patient</Audience></SpanishTermDefinition><DateFirstPublished>2003-10-03</DateFirstPublished></GlossaryTerm>
