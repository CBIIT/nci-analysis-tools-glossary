A LOD score of 3 or higher is generally understood to mean that two genes are located close to each other on the chromosome. In terms of significance, a LOD score of 3 means the odds are 1,000:1 that the two genes are linked and therefore inherited together. Also called logarithm of the odds score.</DefinitionText><Dictionary>Genetics</Dictionary><Audience>Health professional</Audience></TermDefinition><MediaLink ref="CDR0000736969" type="audio/mpeg" alt="Pronunciation of dictionary term &quot;LOD score&quot;" language="en" id="_2"/><DateFirstPublished>2005-03-24</DateFirstPublished><RelatedInformation><RelatedExternalRef UseWith="en" xref="http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=531">LOD Score</RelatedExternalRef></RelatedInformation></GlossaryTerm>
